Python **Automated Unit Testing** was implemented using the [Django Unit Testing](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.2/topics/testing/overview/) framework.  
**Unit Tests** have been written to cover all major parts of the code like **Forms**, **Models**, **Views**, **Admin**, **Context-Processors** and **Fields**. The tests were created to cover all key aspects of the code. Only the checkout app has a moderate coverage, but here manual testing was applied.
A total of **226** **Unit Tests** have been written. All **226** tests ran successfully without errors or warnings.
