## <a name="automated-testing">Automated Testing</a>

Python **Automated Unit Testing** was implemented using the [Django Unit Testing](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.2/topics/testing/overview/) framework.  
**Unit Tests** have been written to cover all major parts of the code like **Forms**, **Models**, **Views**, **Admin**, **Context-Processors** and **Fields**. The tests were created to cover all key aspects of the code. Only the checkout app has a moderate coverage, but here manual testing was applied.
A total of **226** **Unit Tests** have been written. All **226** tests ran successfully without errors or warnings.

### <a name="html">HTML</a>
All **HTML** code was validated using the [W3C Markup Validation Service](https://validator.w3.org/) regularly during the development process. **The HTML Source Code** was regularly viewed for each page using **Google Chrome** and passed through the [W3C Markup Validation Service](https://validator.w3.org/). Various minor errors were encountered and corrected during the final **HTML** validation check.
