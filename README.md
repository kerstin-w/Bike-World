![Colour Palette](documentation/colours.png)

To create a simple design that does not distract customers from the essential areas, only few colors are used. ![#FFFFFF](https://placehold.co/15x15/FFFFFF/FFFFFF.png) White is used as the main background color, which creates a clear and bright design. 
The font is predominantly black, which creates a good contrast and is easily readable for customers. 
Certain areas and segments have a ![#DFDFDF](https://placehold.co/15x15/DFDFDF/DFDFDF.png) light gray color to highlight and accentuate them. This provides a subtle contrast to the predominantly white background and draws attention to important elements of the design. 
An ![#CD4C1D](https://placehold.co/15x15/CD4C1D/CD4C1D.png) orange color has been chosen for all call-to-action buttons and promotional/sale segments. This color stands out and grabs the user's attention, as Bike World wants to guide the customer to the checkout and purchase process as easily as possible. The orange color creates a sense of urgency and encourages the user to take action. By using this color, Bike World aims to optimize the user experience, drive sales and reduce the abondend cart rate.

After testing the accessibility, the inital orange was changed to a darker orange to achieve a better contrast between the orange background and the white text from buttons.

## <a name="images">Images</a>

In an online shop, images are an essential element of the user experience. They provide visual cues and help users understand what the products look like in real life. In my shop, I have used images in the hero banner and category callouts to showcase the bikes in action. The hero banner is the first thing that users see when they arrive on the site. By using an image that shows a bike in action, users can quickly understand the main purpose of the site and the type of products that are being sold. This helps to create an emotional connection with the user and encourages them to explore the site further. Similarly, the category callouts use images to showcase the different types of bikes that are available. By showing the bikes in action, users can understand how they might use the bikes in their own lives. This helps to make the products more relatable and can encourage users to make a purchase.
Product images from the [**Kegel**](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tysonpo/bike-ads-images-prices-specifications?select=data_bike_exchange.json) data set were used for the PDPs. Improvements are still desirable in this regard. In an ideal scenario, there would be several pictures of the bike with detail shots. The format would be webp and the quality a slightly better so that a zoom could also be built in.
